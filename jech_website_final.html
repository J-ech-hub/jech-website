    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Brian, 20 years old and driven by a passion to bring people together. I believe in connection, collaboration, and creating opportunities that help us all succeed — especially when it comes to making money and building something big as a team.</p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <h3>Project 1: Cold Drinks Business</h3>
    <p>As a student in Mombasa, I noticed the constant heat and high demand for refreshing drinks. So I came up with a simple yet powerful business idea: selling cold drinks around campus. With a steady student population and warm climate, the opportunity is both real and reliable. This is my first step into entrepreneurship — solving a real need with a cool solution.</p>

    <h3>Project 2: The Vision Lounge</h3>
    <p>Beyond just selling cold drinks, I dream of setting up a well-conditioned space where people can relax, connect, and talk about things that matter — ideas, money, innovation, and impact. A place where students, thinkers, and creatives can gather over a drink and discuss how we can all build something bigger together. It’s more than business — it’s a movement.</p>

    <h3>Project 3: Advertise With Me</h3>
    <p>I’m opening up space on my website for students, small business owners, and side hustlers to showcase their products and services. Whether it's snacks, fashion, tutoring, or tech — my site is where people come to connect and grow. If you have something to promote, I’ve got you covered.</p>
